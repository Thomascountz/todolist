To Do List
----------

A simple todo list webapp using html, css, and jQuery.

[HOW TO USE THE APP]

[TO ADD] Type a task of less than 24 characters into the text box and press the 'add' button.

[TO DELETE] Click on the task once to turn it red, then again to remove it. Once a task is red, moving your mouse away from it will return it to it's normal state. To delete this same task, you must click it again to, once again, turn it red, then while leaving our mouse above it, click once more.
